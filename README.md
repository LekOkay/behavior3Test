# behavior3Test

## A simple example on how to implement the behavior3 lib in nodejs (and similarly in the browser)

Note: the behavior3 lib does not support nodejs currently so there is an included version of it in the lib folder that works with node.

This is a simple behavior tree built off the example given in the great article by Chris Simpson on behavior trees [here](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/ChrisSimpson/20140717/221339/Behavior_trees_for_AI_How_they_work.php)

Download the sample and run node app and you will get an output
